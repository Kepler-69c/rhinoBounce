## Rhino-Bounce

A simple physics sandbox, built with the javascript library `matter.js`.

This was supposed to be an experiment with the library, but the main goal was probably to make some badly drawn rhinos bounce around.

If you want to try it yourself, here is the website: [epler-69c.github.io/rhinoBounce/](https://kepler-69c.github.io/rhinoBounce/)
